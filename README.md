# HTMLGrabberProject

This is a simple Google Chrome Extension that will scrape the HTML tags off of a live webpage and display them to you in a list. Each 
list item is clickable and will take you to the Mozilla Developer Network for that tag. To get it up in running you just need to load it in
to your google chrome extensions.
